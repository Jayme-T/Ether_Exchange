                <h1> About the project </h1>
                <p> This project was done as a front end personal project to demonstrate my current knowledge of web development. Right now, I am part of Galvanize's full stack development program. For the past five weeks I have been learning front end development
                    and wanted/needed to create an application that showed my understanding of the languages we learned, used API's to access data, involved something I am interested in, and could potentially serve a purpose for an outside user.
                </p>

                <h1> Why ethers </h1>
                <p>I chose to use Ethereum as a starting point for the personal project because it combines a few things I am interested in (decentralization, markets, data, math). Ethereum is a public blockchain. It offers an opprotunity for decentrilization
                    of currency and <b>other
                    contracts </b>. It is similar to bitcoin in that it has a cryptocurrency built in but unlike bitcoin it is more then just a currency. Bitcoin is written in a turing incomplete language and because of this is limited in it's functionality
                    to solve all problems. Ethereum is written in a turing complete language and thus can be used to make smart contracts and offers the ability to share documents/contracts/keys/other data through a public ledger. Last week Bitcoin announced
                    that they will be offering Ethers and this tuesday they began offering them on their coinbase site. With the largest digital currency now offering ethers it seemed relavant to create a currency converter that converts between bitcoin/ethers
                    and physical currencies. This was the starting point of my site. Once the converter was implemented I thought of what other resources a user might be interested in and thought a graph of the data was relavent to people hoping to invest
                    in ethers as a way to make money</p>
