# Personal Project Assignment
### Ethereum/bitcoin/markets

-- This is a personal project that is exploring Ethereum's API. I am working on creating a converter that converts from Ethers to btc and USD as well as other currencies. If time I am also hoping to add a graph of market updates in real time. Bitcoin annouced last Thursday that starting this Tuesday (5/23/16) coinbase will also be offering ethers. That makes this type of conversion more prominent in future transaction within the digital currency realm.
