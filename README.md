# Ether Exchange


#### A personal front end project

Welcome to Ether Exchange! This site was created as a web application that was developed so users can see the current conversion rate between ethers, bitcoin, and other frequently used currencies. In addition to currency conversions based on user input, Ether Exchange offers users the ability to look at graphs showing conversion rates, and fluctuations within conversion rates, for the current day or for the past month depending on what the user specifies. This asset is intended to help the user understand market trends of the currency (Ethers) associated with the Ethereum platform.

Before delving into my site, I want to start by explaining that my site uses Ethereum’s API.
  - this  can be found at: https://etherchain.org/documentation/api/#api-Statistics-GetStatisticsAll
  - It is an easy to use API that walks through the different
    requests needed to access different data.

Ethereum is an organization focused on using blockchain to promote decentralization. As part of this they are able to create contracts that are suppose to codify, enforce and automate the workings of an organization, including governance, fund-raising, operations, spending and expansion The Thursday before this project was created (May 20, 2016) Bitcoin announced they were going to start offering Ethers on their Coinbase site. With this news it seemed relevant to provide a tool that allowed users to see the real-time exchange rates between these currencies.

This site was written using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and bootstrap. It incorporates AJAX requests to access two different API’s and DOM manipulation to navigate through the JSON parsed objects that were returned from the API’s. It includes the use of higher order functions and Chartjs. It utilizes a multitude of functions, including higher order functions and nested functions to to perform the various tasks that the site offers. I also added event listeners to call some of the functions and to respond to user input. I worked with Charts.js to help create the graphs while demonstrating my ability to use and learn a new tool that was not presented as part of our class work. I hope that you have enjoyed looking at the site. Please contact me with any questions.
