#### A personal front end project

Welcome to Ether Exchange! This site was created as a web application that was developed so users can see the current conversion rate between ethers, bitcoin, and other frequently used currencies. In addition to currency conversions based on user input, Ether Exchange offers users the ability to look at graphs showing conversion rates, and fluctuations within conversion rates, for the current day or for the past month depending on what the user specifies. This asset is intended to help the user understand market trends of the currency (Ethers) associated with the Ethereum platform.

This site was written using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and bootstrap. It incorporates AJAX requests to access two different API’s and DOM manipulation to navigate through the JSON parsed objects that were returned from the API’s. It includes the use of higher order functions and Chartjs. I also added event listeners to call some of the functions and to respond to user input. I worked with Charts.js to help create the graphs while demonstrating my ability to use and learn a new tool that was not presented as part of our class work. I hope that you have enjoyed looking at the site. Please contact me with any questions.

Please see a video of the site!
