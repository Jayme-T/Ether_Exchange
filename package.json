  "description": "-- This is a personal project that is exploring Ethereum's API. I am working on creating a converter that converts from Ethers to btc and USD as well as other currencies. If time I am also hoping to add a graph of market updates in real time. Bitcoin annouced last Thursday that starting this Tuesday (5/23/16) coinbase will also be offering ethers. That makes this type of conversion more prominent in future transaction within the digital currency realm. #### I am adding 4 picture files with the wireframes for my Project - The first one is simply a page that is very simple a large title and some buttons to click to get to the part of the page you are looking for - The second is an about part that explains a bit about the Project. why I felt there was a need for this type of application, how the project is set up. etc. - The third is the currency converter. It will include a few buttons to navigate to other pages from this site but the whole purpose of this section is for the application that takes the user input in ethereum and converts it to a different currenty - Finally I have the page with the market graph. I am not going to make the wire frame for this section until I complete the section so I don't bit off more then I can chew.",
